# Kondis-Python-Portfolio
 
# Showcases significant Python projects that display technical skills, data analysis, and creative abilities.
# Projects will be organized by both technical purpose and research topics. 
# I will use folders to seperate out projects first by their main research category grouping those with similar invesigative contexts to provide readers with a collection of related works.
# I will then also seperate projects by their technical purpose and results with different folders for EDA's, visualizations, and statistic models.
