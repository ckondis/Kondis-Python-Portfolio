## 📈 Current Projects: 

**Streamlit App:** https://github.com/ckondis/Kondis-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/basic_streamlit_app

**🔍 Purpose:**
- This project uses Python and Streamlit, an open-source framework that turns Python scripts into interactive data apps. This project utilizes data from an CSV file containing information on dog breeds.
- The app displays a data table of breed characteristics and includes interactive filters to help users explore the dataset in more detail.

**💡 Portfolio Connection:**
- Demonstrates knowledge in Streamlit app building, creating interactive data tables and filters, and developing user-friendly online applications using Python technical skills. 

**Tidy Data Project:** https://github.com/ckondis/Kondis-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project

**🔍 Purpose:**
- Analyzed U.S. federal spending across 14 agencies (1976-2017) to identify patterns and trends.
- Cleaned and structured data using tidy data principles for efficient variable extraction and analysis.
- Visualized insights through pivot tables, aggregations, and plots to make spending behaviors more clear and accessible.

**💡 Portfolio Connection:**
  - Showcases proficiency in tidy data principles, strucutring and manipulating DataFrames, analyzing data sets for trends/research purposes, and presenting insights through meaningful and effective visualizations.
  - Shows continual growth of Python skills and creative analysis of data sets

**NER spaCy App:** https://github.com/ckondis/Kondis-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/NERStreamlitApp

**🔍 Purpose:**
- This app explores spaCy's Named Entity Recognition (NER) and how spaCy processes and identities entities like people, organizations, and dates using a pre-trained NLP pipeline.
- The user can create custom entity rules by specifying labels and matching patterns which is ideal for domain-specific terms like product names, roles, or topics.
- The app allows for users to upload or input text and the app visualizes entities, highlighting by entity type, combining both built-in and custom NER results in an intuitive, color-coded format.

**💡 Portfolio Connection:**
- Highlights experience in building interactive NLP tools with Streamlit, integrating libraries like spaCy and Pandas to create user-focused applications.
- Reflects growth in Python programming, especially data manipulation, natural language processing, and using apps to communicate insights effectively in real-world scenarios.
