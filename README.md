## 📈 Current Projects: 

## Introductory Streamlit App:
**Link:** https://github.com/ckondis/Kondis-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/basic_streamlit_app

**🔍 Purpose:**
- This project uses Python and Streamlit, an open-source framework that turns Python scripts into interactive data apps. This project utilizes data from an CSV file containing information on dog breeds.
- The app displays a data table of breed characteristics and includes interactive filters to help users explore the dataset in more detail.

**💡 Portfolio Connection:**
- Demonstrates knowledge in Streamlit app building, creating interactive data tables and filters, and developing user-friendly online applications using Python technical skills. 

## Tidy Data Project:
**Link:** https://github.com/ckondis/Kondis-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project

**🔍 Purpose:**
- Analyzed U.S. federal spending across 14 agencies (1976-2017) to identify patterns and trends.
- Cleaned and structured data using tidy data principles for efficient variable extraction and analysis.
- Visualized insights through pivot tables, aggregations, and plots to make spending behaviors more clear and accessible.

**💡 Portfolio Connection:**
  - Showcases proficiency in tidy data principles, strucutring and manipulating DataFrames, analyzing data sets for trends/research purposes, and presenting insights through meaningful and effective visualizations.
  - Shows continual growth of Python skills and creative analysis of data sets

## NER spaCy App:
**Link:** https://github.com/ckondis/Kondis-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/NERStreamlitApp

**🔍 Purpose:**
- This app explores spaCy's Named Entity Recognition (NER) and how spaCy processes and identities entities like people, organizations, and dates using a pre-trained NLP pipeline.
- The user can create custom entity rules by specifying labels and matching patterns which is ideal for domain-specific terms like product names, roles, or topics.
- The app allows for users to upload or input text and the app visualizes entities, highlighting by entity type, combining both built-in and custom NER results in an intuitive, color-coded format.

**💡 Portfolio Connection:**
- Highlights experience in building interactive NLP tools with Streamlit, integrating libraries like spaCy and Pandas to create user-focused applications.
- Reflects growth in Python programming, especially data manipulation, natural language processing, and using apps to communicate insights effectively in real-world scenarios.

## Real Estate Investment Analyzer: Streamlit App
**Link:** https://github.com/ckondis/Kondis-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/StreamlitAppFinal

**🔍 Purpose:**
- An interactive app that visualizes housing and demographic trends across U.S. metro areas to support real estate investment analysis and market comparison.
- Provides an interactive platform to explore metro-level U.S. housing and demographic trends using Zillow and census data.
- Helps users identify investment opportunities, compare markets, and interpret real estate indicators visually and intuitively.
- Simplifies complex real estate analysis through educational insights, dynamic charts, and custom filtering tools.

**💡 Portfolio Connection:**
- Demonstrates advanced Python development by building an interactive, user-focused app that combines real estate data analysis, dynamic visualizations, and investment metrics.
- Showcases model deployment skills by evolving from static analysis to a fully deployed tool that supports real-world market evaluation and decision-making.
- **Connection to Interests:** As a real estate student, this app was a way to dive deeper into metro-level housing data and build a tool that helps analyze growth potential, compare markets, and think through investment strategies in a more applied, visual way.
