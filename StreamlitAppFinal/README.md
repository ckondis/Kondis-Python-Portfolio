# üèôÔ∏è **Metropolitan Area Investment Analyzer**
Welcome to the **Metropolitan Area Investment Analyzer** ‚Äî a real estate analytics tool designed to help investors, developers, movers,

or deciding where to move next, this tool provides **accessible and visual insights** into **housing market dynamics** across the country.

# üìå **Purpose**
This interactive Streamlit app aims to **simplify metro-level** real estate analysis by integrating Zillow housing data, demographic trends, and investment indicators into a single platform.

This app bridges that gap by:

- Aggregating housing and demographic data at the metro level
- Providing easy-to-use filtering and comparison tools
- Offering instant visual insights to support investment research
